## Which architecture should you choose for an application?

Monolithic architecture - architect an application as a single deployable unit
Microservice architecture - architect an application as a collection of loosely coupled, services

## How to decompose an application into services?

Decompose by business capability - define services corresponding to business capabilities
Decompose by subdomain - define services corresponding to DDD subdomains
Self-contained Service - design services to handle synchronous requests without waiting for other services to respondnew
Service per teamnew

Strangler Application
Anti-corruption layer

## How to maintain data consistency and implement queries?

Database per Service - each service has its own private database
Shared database - services share a database
Saga - use sagas, which a sequences of local transactions, to maintain data consistency across services
Command-side replica - maintain a queryable replica of data in a service that implements a command
API Composition - implement queries by invoking the services that own the data and performing an in-memory join
CQRS - implement queries by maintaining one or more materialized views that can be efficiently queried
Domain event - publish an event whenever data changes
Event sourcing - persist aggregates as a sequence of events
Transactional messaging
How to publish messages as part of a database transaction?

Transactional outbox
Transaction log tailing
Polling publisher
How to make testing easier?

Consumer-driven contract test - a test suite for a service that is written by the developers of another service that consumes it
Consumer-side contract test - a test suite for a service client (e.g. another service) that verifies that it can communicate with the service
Service component sest - a test suite that tests a service in isolation using test doubles for any services that it invokes
How to deploy an application’s services?

Multiple service instances per host - deploy multiple service instances on a single host
Service instance per host - deploy each service instance in its own host
Service instance per VM - deploy each service instance in its VM
Service instance per Container - deploy each service instance in its container
Serverless deployment - deploy a service using serverless deployment platform
Service deployment platform - deploy services using a highly automated deployment platform that provides a service abstraction
How to handle cross cutting concerns?

Microservice chassis - a framework that handles cross-cutting concerns and simplifies the development of services
Externalized configuration - externalize all configuration such as database location and credentials
Service Template - a template that implements standard cross cutting concerns and is intended to be copied by a developer in order to quickly start developing a new service
Style
Which communication mechanisms do services use to communicate with each other and their external clients?

Remote Procedure Invocation - use an RPI-based protocol for inter-service communication
Messaging - use asynchronous messaging for inter-service communication
Domain-specific protocol - use a domain-specific protocol
Idempotent Consumer - ensure that message consumers can cope with being invoked multiple times with the same message
External API
How do external clients communicate with the services?

API gateway - a service that provides each client with unified interface to services
Backend for front-end - a separate API gateway for each kind of client
Service discovery
How does the client of an RPI-based service discover the network location of a service instance?

Client-side discovery - client queries a service registry to discover the locations of service instances
Server-side discovery - router queries a service registry to discover the locations of service instances
Service registry - a database of service instance locations
Self registration - service instance registers itself with the service registry
3rd party registration - a 3rd party registers a service instance with the service registry
Reliability
How to prevent a network or service failure from cascading to other services?

Circuit Breaker - invoke a remote service via a proxy that fails immediately when the failure rate of the remote call exceeds a threshold
How to communicate the identity of the requestor to the services that handle the request?

Access Token - a token that securely stores information about user that is exchanged between services
How to understand the behavior of an application and troubleshoot problems?

Log aggregation - aggregate application logs
Application metrics - instrument a service’s code to gather statistics about operations
Audit logging - record user activity in a database
Distributed tracing - instrument services with code that assigns each external request an unique identifier that is passed between services. Record information (e.g. start time, end time) about the work (e.g. service requests) performed when handling the external request in a centralized service

Exception tracking - report all exceptions to a centralized exception tracking service that aggregates and tracks exceptions and notifies developers.

Health check API - service API (e.g. HTTP endpoint) that returns the health of the service and is intended to be pinged, for example, by a monitoring service

Log deployments and changes
How to implement a UI screen or page that displays data from multiple services?

Server-side page fragment composition - build a webpage on the server by composing HTML fragments generated by multiple, business capability/subdomain-specific web applications

Client-side UI composition - Build a UI on the client by composing UI fragments rendered by multiple, business capability/subdomain-specific UI components
